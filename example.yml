# - Use {} to wrap a set name, egs "... {mysetName} ..."
# - Define multiple set names by separting them with "|", egs "... {mysetName|anotherSet} ..."
# - // denotes optional items, egs "... /foo/ ..." here "foo" has a 50% chance of appearing
# - You can also make sets options "... /{myset}/ ..." 
# - as well as mixed"... /foo {myset}/ ..." 
# - use [X{set}] to denonate how many times a set value will be injected, egs "... [2{mysetName}] ..." mysetName will be added twice
# - use [X-Y{set}] to set a min and max nr of repeats (randomly chosen)
# - use [X-Y,{set}] to set a separator, here "," is specified
